# Developer Kickstart: Testing and Debugging
This repository is an essential segment of the Developer Kickstart curriculum at Cloud Code Academy. Tailored specifically for up-and-coming Salesforce developers, this module plunges into the crucial aspects of testing and debugging, underscoring the necessity of robust test classes, effective debugging strategies, and the maintenance of high code coverage.

## Goals of the Practice
During this repository, you will deepen your grasp of:

- The imperative role of test classes in ensuring the reliability and stability of your Apex code within Salesforce.
- Crafting and deploying well-structured test methods to cover a multitude of scenarios, both positive and negative.
- The importance of achieving and maintaining a high code coverage percentage, ensuring every line of code is vetted for functionality.
- Mastering Salesforce's built-in debugging tools, such as the Developer Console, to identify, diagnose, and resolve issues efficiently.
- Incorporating systematic logging and exception handling to provide clarity on runtime behaviors and unexpected errors.

By excelling in these testing and debugging techniques, you'll bolster your capability to write resilient and fault-tolerant code. This strengthens your expertise in ensuring that Salesforce applications are not only functional but also reliable, emphasizing the best practices that underpin top-tier Salesforce development.
