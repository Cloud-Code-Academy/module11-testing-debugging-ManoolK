/*
 * The `LeadTriggerHandler` class contains methods designed to handle various business requirements around
 * the Lead object in Salesforce. This includes functionality like normalizing the title field of a lead, 
 * automatically scoring leads based on certain criteria, and auto-converting leads when certain conditions are met.
 * - Create a test class for `LeadTriggerHandler` to ensure all methods work as expected.
 * - Update the LeadTrigger class to call the `LeadTriggerHandler` methods as needed.
 *
 * Students should note:
 * - This class may contain intentional errors that need to be fixed for proper functionality.
 * - Create a corresponding test class for `LeadTriggerHandler` to ensure all methods work as expected.
 *   Both positive and negative test cases should be considered.
 *
 * Documentation on Lead conversion and Test Classes can be found here:

	 * Requirement Lead Title Normalization - handleTitleNormalization
	 * Occasionally, users input titles in a variety of ways. Streamline these titles for consistency:
	 *
	 * Criteria:
	 * - If the title contains terms such as 'vp', 'v.p.', or 'vice president',
	 *   change the title to 'Vice President'.
	 * - If the title contains terms like 'mgr', 'manage', or 'head of department',
	 *   change the title to 'Manager'.
	 * - Should the title include words like 'exec', 'chief', or 'head',
	 *   change the title to 'Executive'.
	 * - If the title contains terms like 'assist', 'deputy', or 'jr',
	 *   change the title to 'Assistant'.

	 * Requirement Auto Lead Scoring - handleAutoLeadScoring
	 * Implement logic to automatically assign scores to leads based on specific criteria.

	 *
	 * Criteria:
	 * - If the lead source is from the website and an email exists, increment score by 3 points.
	 * - If the lead provides a phone number, increment score by 5 points.
	 * - If the lead belongs to the 'Technology' industry, increment score by another 10 points.

	/* 
	 * Question 3
	 * Requirement Automatic Lead Conversion Based on Email Match - handleLeadAutoConvert
	 * Whenever a new Lead is created or an existing Lead's email address is updated,
	 * check for a matching Contact based on the email address. If a single matching
	 * Contact is identified, auto-convert the Lead.
	 * Use the Salesforce report Converted Lead to verify that the Lead was converted to the correct Contact.
	 *
	 * Criteria:
	 * - Monitor the "Email" field on the Lead object for creation or updates.
	 * - On Lead creation or email update, search the Contact object for records with the
	 *   same email address.
	 * - If a single matching Contact is identified:
	 *     - Auto-convert the Lead.
	 *     - Merge the Lead details with the existing Contact, ensuring that crucial
	 *       Contact information is preserved.
	 * - If multiple Contacts with the same email are found or no match is identified,
	 *   leave the Lead unconverted.
	 * 
	 * Hint: 
	 * - One of the errors is recursion related. Check if the lead is already converted or check if the email has changed/is null
	 * - One of the errors is map related. Make sure you are using the correct contact map key
